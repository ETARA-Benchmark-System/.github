## Data Sets
The ETARA benchmark system provides ten different data sets of bibliographic and filmographic domains. The bibliographic set contains sample data sets (in RDF format) extracted from dblp, ArXiv, CrossRef, Semantic Scholar and Springer Nature, consisting of meta data of several important conferences and journals (e.g. SIGIR, SIGMOD, CIKM, etc.) from different years (2014 and 2015). We intentionally created small sets because this makes them easier to manually analyze and understand. The bibliographic data sets contain information about titles, publication years, author names, institutions, references and citations. For legal reasons information like abstracts is not provided in the data sets. 

The filmographic set contains meta data of movies created between 2000 and 2012 and covers samples from Linked Movie Database, Open Movie Database and The Movie Database. The data sets cover titles, release dates, actor names, director names and others. For legal reasons information about the movie plot are not provided in the data sets.

## Response Templates and API Configurations
The ETARA benchmark system provides 42 API configurations, including response templates with different structures and granularity. Moreover, many of the provided templates are based on real world APIs, like ArXiv, CrossRef, Semantic Scholar, Springer Nature, Open Movie Database and The Movie Database.

The ETARA Hub is a repository that provides several different categories of Web API configurations, e.g. for bibliographic APIs like CrossRef, for filmographic APIs like the Open Movie Database, more complex JSON response structures, API configurations that respond to request errors with an HTTP status code, and much more. More information about the ETARA Hub can be found [here](etara-hub.md).
