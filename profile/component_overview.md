# Component Overview
The ETARA Benchmark Toolkit consists of several components that together provide a wide variation of configuration, simulation and analysis options. The first component is a management component that consists of a datbase management tool, an Web API simulation tool and a tool to register external (real world) APIs. The second component is used to simulate RESTful Web APIs and provides some configuration options, such as latency, rate limits and also the response structure can be freely configured. The third component consists of a gold standard builder to create gold standard alignments between RDF kowledge bases and RESTful Web APIs or to manually explore and better understand the information of the two data sources. The last component consists of a visualization option of the alignments, called Alignment Cube. This visualization can be used not only to display simple information such as precision, recall and f1 score, but also to perform deeper analysis.
