# Quick Start

In order to run ETARA several configurations must be done first. The cloned project has to be opened (currently) in an IDE of your choice. This step will be replaced soon by simply providing an executable jar file. Afterwards, two steps need to be performed: (1) Providing all necessary global configurations and (2) providing all configurations needed to simulate the chosen Web APIs, i.e., response templates, data sources and more.
