# Quick Start

In order to run ETARA several configurations must be done first. The cloned project has to be opened (currently) in an IDE of your choice. This step will be replaced soon by simply providing an executable jar file. Afterwards, two steps need to be performed: (1) Creating access to the used data sources and (2) providing initial configurations to simulate Web APIs, i.e., response templates, data sources and more.

## Registering Data Sources
To simulate APIs, several requirements needs to be met. First, ETARA needs access to databases that represent the pool of available data for the simulated APIs. Currently, ETARA is only able to process RDF databases, but this aspect will be extended in the future. With a registration of the databases, requested information can be extracted and integrated into response templates.
